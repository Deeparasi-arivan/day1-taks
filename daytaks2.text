Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript:


Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
 These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each 
 (depending on their types).

 Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value.
  That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored.
